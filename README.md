# System Administration Class Notes

This repository contains a collection of notes, resources, and materials I've gathered during my System Administration class as part of my Computer Science major. The content here is a mix of personal notes, code snippets, configuration examples, and other relevant information that I found useful or interesting during my studies.

The topics covered in this repo include (but are not limited to):
- Linux/Unix system administration
- Network configuration and management
- Shell scripting and automation
- Security best practices
- Server management and deployment
- Troubleshooting and debugging

This repository is still a work in progress, as I continue to learn and refine my understanding of system administration concepts. Feel free to explore, use, or contribute to the content if you find it helpful!
